# MoodMap 🗺️

Smart Nearby Places Recommender

## Skills Relevant to AI & Content Systems

This project demonstrates skills that overlap with AI-driven content and recommendation systems:

- Interpreting subjective user inputs (mood) and mapping them to structured system decisions
- Handling ambiguity and user intent, similar to challenges in LLM-generated content
- Designing logic with a focus on clarity, consistency, and usefulness of outputs
- Evaluating system responses based on user experience rather than raw correctness

Building MoodMap strengthened my interest in how intelligent systems interpret human context and how their outputs can be improved for clarity and decision-making.
